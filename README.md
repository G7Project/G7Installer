# G7Installer
G7OS Installer Script. (This just builds G7OS Using Arch)
Licensed under the GPLv3
## This script is a fork of ArchFi (https://github.com/MatMoul/archfi)
It differs from ArchFi with some extra customization and it installs G7OS Programs and dependencies as well. I think this script is helpful.
